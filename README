NAME
    Test::use::ok - Alternative to Test::More::use_ok

SYNOPSIS
        use ok( 'Some::Module' );

DESCRIPTION
    According to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended to run
    "use_ok()" inside a "BEGIN" block, so functions are exported at
    compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

    That is, instead of writing this:

        use_ok( 'Some::Module' );
        use_ok( 'Other::Module' );

    One should write this:

        BEGIN { use_ok( 'Some::Module' ); }
        BEGIN { use_ok( 'Other::Module' ); }

    However, people often either forget to add "BEGIN", or mistakenly group
    "use_ok" with other tests in a single "BEGIN" block, which can create
    subtle differences in execution order.

    With this module, simply change all "use_ok" in test scripts to "use
    ok", and they will be executed at "BEGIN" time. The explicit space after
    "use" makes it clear that this is a single compile-time action.
